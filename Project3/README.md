For my Final Project I choose to do a game I started playing again recently which was Tetris. I decided to add a twist to the game since it is a simple game it can be hard to change. Some of the shapes that fall down are different sizes than the regular game and some of the new shapes have new forms when you try to rotate them. I feel like making a harder version of the game would be fun especially to show my friends and have them try it out.

1. To run this program, you must have python installed and working.

2. Depending on what os you are using you would need to install Pygame. (Windows- pip install pygame) (Mac- pip3 install pygame)

3. Then go ahead and open the file in vscode or use the terminal. 

-The directions of tetris are simple. You want to stack the figures so that it creates full straight lines horizontally.

- To move left, the user must hit the "<" left arrow key
- To move right, the user must hit the ">" right arrow key
- To transform the shape the use must hit the "^" up arrow key
- To make the block come down instantly the user must press the "space bar".

The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible. Once the game has ended
