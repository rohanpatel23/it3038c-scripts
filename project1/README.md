# Project 1

This project is something I want to work on in the future to help benefit myself and my father. I currently do the payroll and timecards for the hotel properties we oversee and I would like to make that job easier with a script I can make myself in python. I am currently getting my feet wet with the calculator and hope to figure out how to properly create the most efficient way to do payroll. The output of the calculator should work as normal, but I added in 2 other options contributing to a payroll which is hours worked and the hour rate so it would show how much the employee gets before taxes. I hope to add taxes when I start to expand on the idea.
