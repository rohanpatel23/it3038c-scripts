# Project 1

This project is something I want to work on in the future to help benefit myself and my father. I currently do the payroll and timecards for the hotel properties we oversee and I would like to make that job easier with a script I can make myself in python. I am currently getting my feet wet with the calculator and hope to figure out how to properly create the most efficient way to do payroll.
